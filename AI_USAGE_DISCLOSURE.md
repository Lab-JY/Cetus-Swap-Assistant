# 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

Per **Rule #6** of the Sui Vibe Hackathon participation requirements, we hereby fully disclose the usage of AI tools in the development of this project.

## 🛠️ AI Tools Used

| Tool Name | Model Version | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Trae IDE** | Gemini-3-Pro-Preview | Primary Pair Programmer, Code Generation, Refactoring |
| **Claude** | 3.5 Sonnet | Logic verification, documentation drafting |

## 📝 Prompts & Usage Scenarios

We employed AI agents primarily for **boilerplate generation**, **API integration patterns**, and **UI component scaffolding**. Below are the specific prompt categories and examples used:

### 1. Cetus SDK Integration
**Goal**: Correctly implement the aggregator and CLMM SDKs.
**Prompts**:
> "How to use @cetusprotocol/aggregator-sdk to fetch swap quotes?"
> "Implement a function `buildSimpleSwapTx` that takes a quote and creates a transaction block for Cetus CLMM."
> "Refactor the swap logic to support slippage tolerance passing."

### 2. Frontend UI/UX (React + Tailwind)
**Goal**: Create a responsive "Swap & Transfer" interface.
**Prompts**:
> "Create a React component `SwapHistory.tsx` that displays a list of transactions with Tailwind styling."
> "Add a tab switcher for 'Swap' and 'Transfer' modes in the main page header."
> "Implement a 'Zap Mode' UI warning when the input token and output token are different."

### 3. ZkLogin Implementation
**Goal**: Integrate the official zkLogin flow.
**Prompts**:
> "Generate a `zklogin.ts` utility file that handles ephemeral key generation and Google OAuth URL construction."
> "How to verify and decode the JWT token from Google in a Next.js callback page?"

### 4. Smart Contract (Move 2024)
**Goal**: Ensure compliance with Move 2024 syntax.
**Prompts**:
> "Convert this Move 2020 module to Move 2024 syntax."
> "Add a `public struct` for `SwapEvent` and ensure all fields have proper visibility modifiers."

## 🔍 Verification
All code generated by AI was manually reviewed, tested, and modified by the human developer to ensure security, correctness, and alignment with the project's specific business logic. The AI acted as a "Copilot," not an autonomous builder.
